# ChinoBot v1.1 by Davidlinye
#
# New features:
# -Users can now add a counter for any phrase with the command ?addcounter "your text here" (not case sensitive, but it saves the given text raw)
# -Users can now delete any existing counter with ?delcounter "your text here" (not case sensitive)
# -The owner can set the value of any counter to any number. This is in case a counter got removed by accident
# -New prefix: ? instead of $ for easier typing
